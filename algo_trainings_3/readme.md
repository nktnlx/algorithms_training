My notes and code from following the Algorithms Trainings 3.0 by Yandex (Spring 2023):  
  
`pics` - folder to host images embeddded into notebooks in the repository  
`0_intro.ipynb` - introduction to the trainings, solving two tasks  
`01_stacks.ipynb` - Lesson 1. Stacks  
`02_queues.ipynb` - Lesson 2. Queue, Deque, Heap   
`03_dynamic_programming.ipynb` - Lesson 3. Dynamic programming with one parameter    
`04_dynamic_programming.ipynb` - Lesson 4. Dynamic programming with two parameters
