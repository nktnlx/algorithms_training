In programming, stacks are often used to implement algorithms and to manage memory allocation. For example, in the recursive function calls, the function calls are added to the stack as they occur and removed from the stack as they are completed. "

    "Stacks can be useful in a variety of tasks and algorithms, including:\n",
    "1.  Parentheses matching: In many programming languages, parentheses must be properly matched, so a stack can be used to keep track of opening and closing parentheses.\n",
    "2. Function call stack: As mentioned earlier, stacks are used to keep track of function calls in many programming languages. As each function is called, it is added to the stack, and as each function completes, it is removed from the stack.\n",
    "3. Expression evaluation: Stacks can be used to evaluate expressions, such as postfix expressions, where operands are added to the stack, and operators are applied to the top elements on the stack.\n",
    "4. Backtracking algorithms: Backtracking algorithms, such as the N-Queens problem or the 8-Queens problem, often use a stack to store the current state of the solution.\n",
    "5. Memory allocation: Stacks can be used to manage memory allocation, where the stack keeps track of the available memory blocks and the allocated memory blocks.  \n",
