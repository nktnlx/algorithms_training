    "The streets of Manhattan are organized as follows. From south to north, there is an avenue every hundred meters, and from west to east, there is a street every hundred meters. Avenues and streets are numbered with integers. Lower numbers correspond to western avenues and southern streets. Thus, a rectangular coordinate system can be constructed so that the point (x, y) lies at the intersection of the x-th avenue and the y-th street. It is easy to notice that in order to walk from point (x1, y1) to point (x2, y2) in Manhattan, you need to go through |x2 - x1| + |y2 - y1| blocks. This distance is called the Manhattan distance between points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2).  \n",

Every minute, Mike either stays at the same intersection as a minute ago, or moves one block in any direction. To avoid getting lost, Mike takes a navigator with him, which tells him his location every t minutes. Unfortunately, the navigator does not show Mike's exact location; it can show any of the points whose Manhattan distance to Mike does not exceed d.  \n",
